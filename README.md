ocws-admin-bar-greeting

## Version 1.6
Updated and tested for Wordpress 4.6

## Version 1.2
The first majr version of the plugin

The standard Wordpress greeting of "howdy" is irritating. This plugin replaces that greeting with a more formal "Welcome". It also allows the user to alter the greeting as they see fit.
